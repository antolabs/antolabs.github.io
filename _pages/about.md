I develop AI-driven design methodologies for advanced nuclear engineering systems, combining deep reinforcement learning with metal 3D printing to create innovative components.

My research focuses on:
* AI optimization of thermal-fluid devices for high-power applications
* Magnetohydrodynamic pump designs for liquid metal systems
* 3D printing applications

I'm particularly interested in bridging computational design and physical fabrication—turning AI-discovered geometries into real, manufacturable parts for next-generation reactors and accelerators.
