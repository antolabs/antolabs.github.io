Welcome! I am a Scientist (Staff) at the [Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), Michigan State University](https://frib.msu.edu/).

My research is focused on a new approach that combines **artificial intelligence (AI)** and **additive manufacturing (3D printing)** to solve complex challenges in nuclear engineering.

I develop and apply novel AI frameworks, particularly deep reinforcement learning (DRL), to discover innovative component designs that are far more efficient than what is possible by human intuition. This work has already provided high-impact solutions for mission-critical applications, such as improving the power-handling capabilities of accelerator components and pioneering more efficient designs for heat exchangers and electromagnetic pumps in advanced reactors.

My main research interests include:
* AI (Reinforcement Learning) design optimization
* Heat exchangers
* Electromagnetic pumps
* Metal 3D printing
