#### Sodium Fast Reactor Applications

Designed and analyzed rectangular, cylindrical, and helical-type DC electromagnetic pumps for liquid sodium circulation in GenIV sodium fast reactors. Comparative analysis was performed across various pump geometries, with detailed MHD investigations on magnetic flux density, current distribution, and Lorentz force characteristics.

#### Heavy-ion Accelerator Applications

Optimized a rectangular DC electromagnetic pump for liquid lithium circulation in a heavy-ion accelerator. The pump achieved 1.5 MPa developed pressure at 6 cm³/s flow rate for forming liquid lithium films used in uranium charge stripping.
